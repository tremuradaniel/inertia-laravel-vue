# Inertia

JavaScript apps the monolith way
Inertia is a new approach to building classic server-driven web apps. We call it the modern monolith.

Inertia allows you to create fully client-side rendered, single-page apps, without much of the complexity that comes with modern SPAs. It does this by leveraging existing server-side frameworks.

Inertia has no client-side routing, nor does it require an API. Simply build controllers and page views like you've always done!
